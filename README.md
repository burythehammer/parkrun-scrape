[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/burythehammer/parkrun-scrape.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/burythehammer/parkrun-scrape)

Lots of information is available on the official parkrun website. But it's not easily analysable! This project should help you get the data you need to make some fun analysis.

### Getting Started

Install go, clone the repo, run `make` and you're off!
